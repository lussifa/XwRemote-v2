In a network far far away...

An IT guy got frustrated about
fighting so many applications...

So many thing to do...
So many applications open...

Lets create a weapon to battle them all

With the help of the Open Source Rebels
he started to craft away this weapon

The path is not easy, and its slow going
but advances are being made!!!
